										Since the Industrial Revolution, the ocean has absorbed about one-third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, acidifying at the fastest rate in 300 million years (rising CO2 levels, falling pH), inevitably affecting key processes and functions of marine ecosystems. Over half of the global ocean area is nitrogen-limited, impacting primary productivity. The dominant nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Trichodesmium, is a significant nitrogen source in oligotrophic areas, contributing up to 50% of the total marine nitrogen fixation, thereby significantly influencing marine primary productivity and climate regulation functions. Thus, the impact of ocean acidification on Trichodesmium and its effects has garnered considerable attention.
										Around this critical scientific issue, Professor Stalin's research team and collaborators have conducted systematic and in-depth studies over the past decade. They discovered that ocean acidification inhibits the nitrogen-fixing function of Trichodesmium, and this inhibitory effect is intensified under iron limitation (PNAS 2012). For the first time, the mechanism of how ocean acidification inhibits nitrogen fixation in Trichodesmium was revealed, distinguishing the dual effects of acidification (CO2 rise and pH fall). It was found that the positive effect of rising CO2 is smaller than the negative effect of decreasing pH, hence the net effect of acidification is to inhibit nitrogen fixation in Trichodesmium, which was validated in field experiments with natural Trichodesmium communities in the South China Sea (Science 2017). 
										The study elucidated that iron limitation forces Trichodesmium to shift iron from the photosynthetic system and respiratory chain to increase the synthesis of iron-rich nitrogenase to cope with the decrease in nitrogen fixation efficiency caused by acidification, thus affecting cellular energy production (Photosynthesis Research 2019). Based on experimental elucidation of the mechanism, a "resource optimization" cellular energy model for Trichodesmium was established, effectively simulating the optimization and utilization of energy and iron in key cellular processes, to cope with the combined stress of acidification and iron limitation, achieving maximized growth and nitrogen fixation rates (Nature Communications 2019).
										In addition to iron, phosphorus is also an important nutrient limiting the growth and nitrogen fixation of Trichodesmium. Therefore, the response of Trichodesmium to ocean acidification is likely also regulated by changes in phosphorus supply. To date, international studies on how Trichodesmium responds to ocean acidification under phosphorus limitation have all used semi-continuous culture methods, where the concentration of phosphorus in the culture system cannot be maintained at a stable low concentration. This may be one of the important reasons for the inconsistent responses of Trichodesmium to acidification in different studies. Recently, building upon previous research, Professor Stalin's team and collaborators have used long-term acclimatization to acidification combined with chemostat continuous culture techniques to deeply explore the impact and mechanism of acidification on carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, and phosphorus metabolic pathways in Trichodesmium long-term adapted to steady-state phosphorus limitation.

											<h2>Research Findings</h2>

										The study found that acidification significantly inhibits the photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation of phosphorus-limited Trichodesmium. The contents of particulate organic carbon (POC) and organic nitrogen (PON) in cells correspondingly decrease, while the content of particulate organic phosphorus (POP) significantly increases under acidified conditions, leading to a decrease in POC:POP and PON:POP ratios. This suggests that acidification will reduce the amount of carbon and nitrogen fixation supported by each unit of phosphorus in phosphorus-limited Trichodesmium. By analyzing the main phosphorus-containing substances in cells, the research team found that the increase in POP is mainly due to the rise in cellular polyphosphate (polyP) under acidified conditions, which may be related to the function of polyP in maintaining intracellular pH homeostasis to cope with acidification stress. Transcriptomic analysis and analysis of related metabolic products indicated that acidification downregulated the expression of the key enzyme gene ppnK catalyzing NAD phosphorylation, which may help reduce the consumption of the phosphate group donor polyP, to maintain high intracellular polyP levels. However, the rise in polyP content under acidified conditions was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular NADP(H):NAD(H) and chlorophyll concentration, causing affected cell yields, thereby inhibiting carbon and nitrogen fixation, with this inhibitory effect being more significant than under phosphorus-sufficient conditions. Field experiments conducted on phosphorus-limited natural Trichodesmium communities in the South China Sea based on laboratory experiments corroborated the findings of the indoor experiments.

										Based on the above experimental results, the research team used the simulation outcomes from the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling Model embedded in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to estimate the impact of the coupled effects of ocean acidification and phosphorus limitation on global Trichodesmium nitrogen fixation. The results indicate that by the end of this century, global Trichodesmium nitrogen fixation will decrease by 22.8 Tg N yr-1 due to the combined effects of acidification and phosphorus limitation, with the most significant declines observed in the Western Pacific and the Northern Indian Ocean.
